VENUE (TeamName, VenueName, Location, Capacity)
Step 1: 1NF
All attributes are atomic
Step 2: 2NF
Only one primary key so already in 2NF
Step 3: 3NF
Transitive dependencies between Location + Capacity, VenueName, and TeamName.
Create new VENUE_DETAILS table
VENUE(TeamName, VenueName)
VENUE_DETAILS(VenueName, Location, Capacity)
Step 4: BCNF
Only one PK in each table so already in BCNF


REFEREE (Ref_ID, Fname, Lname, Birthdate, StartDate)
Step 1: 1NF
All attributes are atomic
Step 2: 2NF
Only one PK so already in 2NF
Step 3: 3NF
There are no transitive dependencies as all non-key attributes are only dependent on the PK
Step 4: BCNF
Already in BCNF as PK is not a composite key

GAME (Game_ID, Home, Away, Date, HomeScore, AwayScore)
Step 1: 1NF 
All attributes are atomic, there will only be one home team and home score, and one away team and away score. 
Step 2: 2NF 
Only one primary key so already in 2NF.
Step 3: 3NF 
The relation is in 3NF.
Step 4:
The relation is in BCNF

FAN (Fan_ID, First_name, Last_name, Address, Birth_date)
Step 1: 1NF 
All attributes are already atomic and can only be uniquely identified by the primary key. A fan can only have one birthdate, address, first name, and last name.
Step 2: 2NF 
All attributes are already functionally dependent. All attributes are non-prime apart from the singular primary key. 
Step 3: 3NF 
There are no transitive dependencies as all keys are only dependent on the primary key. 
Step 4: BCNF 
The relation is in BCNF.
